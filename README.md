# Recipe

I think everyone writes a program to store recipes at some point in their
lives. This is the one I wrote back in 2006 using the [Eclipse Rich Client
Platform][1].

I originally wrote this for some family members who were looking for something
a bit better than MS Word documents for storing their recipes. This program
fit the bill, they're still using it to this day.

## Building

Import the three projects into Eclipse. I've most recently tried the project
with Eclipse 4.2 RCP (Juno), though it was developed against Eclipse 3.x.
You'll also need to install [swt-paperclips][2] into the target (Eclipse
plugins folder).
